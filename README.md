  This repo contains different tools to generate your own segmentation datasets using your objcet detection YOLOv8 models. This work is a continuation of the article <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-use-yolov8-with-sam/"> "How to use YOLOv8 with SAM" </a>published by Arty Ariuntuya on Roboflow, in which she explained the power of both models working together.

## üé≠ segmentation mask

<p align = "justify">
  After performing object detection with YOLOv8, bounding boxes are sent to SAM, in order to make him understand which object do we want to get the mask from.

## üè∑Ô∏è segmentation dataset automation

<p align = "justify">
  In order to generate your custom segmentation dataset for YOLOv8, you will need to use your custom YOLOv8 object detection model and replace the default model path with yours.
</p>

  After that you will download SAM weights using the following command:

```wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth```
