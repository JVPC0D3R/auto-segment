  This repo contains different tools to generate your own segmentation datasets using your object detection YOLOv8 models. This work is a continuation of the article <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-use-yolov8-with-sam/"> "How to use YOLOv8 with SAM" </a>published by Arty Ariuntuya on Roboflow, in which she explained the power of both models working together.

## üé≠ segmentation mask

<p align = "justify">
  After performing object detection with YOLOv8, bounding boxes are sent to SAM, in order to make him understand which object do we want to get the mask from.

## üì¶ installation

<p align = "justify">
  In order to use this repo you will need to install the following packages on your 3.8 Python environment:
</p>

```pip install roboflow ultralytics 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git'```

<p align = "justify">
  Or you can install them from requirements:
</p>

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

<p align = "justify">
  After that you will download SAM weights using the following command:
</p>

```wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth```

## üè∑Ô∏è segmentation dataset automation

<p align = "justify">
  This repo allows you to atomate a YOLOv8 format segmentation dataset generation process. To start generating your dataset, you will need to copy all your images on the "images" folder, also you will need a custom YOLOv8 object detection model (copy the custom_yolov8.pt ckpt in the main folder).
</p>

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "./examples/example_3.PNG" width = "100%">
  
</p>

<p align = "justify">
  In the "create_dataset.py" script, replace the "yolov8n.pt" string with yout custom YOLOv8 file. 
</p>

```python
# Load the YOLOv8 model
yolo = YOLO('your_custom_yolov8.pt')
```

<p align="justify">
  Keep in mind that this YOLOv8 model will only generate the bounding boxes of the objects and will give that information to SAM.
